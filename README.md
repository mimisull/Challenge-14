**ML TRADING BOT**

Specifically, I am building a tool to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market.

I accomplish this by enhancING the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

*User Story*:
As a user, I need to determine how to profit more off of our trading bot

As a user, I need to be able to program this bot so that it is receptive to new data.
